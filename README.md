## What I thought about this project?

#### It's the first time I tried Neumorphism UI design in my project, which is pretty cool with UI experience.<br>The Google map API offers a lot of customize setting, so I could change it's default style to the style that fits my website.<br>Filtering projects is not a difficult one to build, but supporting multiple languages is kind of tricky, as a result I took Vuex as the tool to build this feature.
